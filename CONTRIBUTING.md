# Contributing to Sanidi

## Welcome to Our Community! 🌍

Sanidi is more than just a Web3 development tool—it's a movement to make blockchain technology accessible to developers across Africa and beyond. We believe that the future of Web3 will be shaped by diverse voices, perspectives, and experiences.

### Our Vision for Contributors
- Build tools that simplify Web3 development
- Create resources in multiple languages, starting with English and Swahili
- Foster an inclusive tech community that celebrates African innovation
- Make Web3 development accessible to developers at all skill levels

### Why Your Perspective Matters
- Different backgrounds bring different solutions
- Local knowledge helps create globally relevant tools
- Diverse languages make Web3 truly accessible
- Your unique experiences shape better features

## Smart Contract Integration (Coming Soon)

We're developing a smart contract system to:
- Track all forms of contributions transparently
- Enable contributors to claim rewards when monetized
- Provide verifiable proof of participation
- Create a decentralized governance structure

*Note: Currently in development. All contributions are tracked via GitHub until launch.*
